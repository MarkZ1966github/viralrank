This is the code for ViralRank

This is and was how we scored news articles on SwarmSports.com 

You can see the dashboard version of this here: http://viralrank.me/dashboard/ - you just have to create an account to utilize

The thing with ViralRank was once Twitter closed off their API, things were never the same. The code included here worked at one point, but will definitely need tweaking to work fully. 

Also like SwarmSports - you need bootstrap to run this correctly. Also if you type in http://viralrank.me - you'll see how it's used as an API to score articles. That actually broke awhile ago, but I have a working copy of it here: http://apitest.nuclearinbox.com/
